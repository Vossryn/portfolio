## My personal portfolio site

Creating ang storing this project in github as a means to show that I can use Git as well as other web technologies.

The project is made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
There may be some random bits of [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) mixed in for the more complex CSS that couldn't be done at the time of creation with Tailwind CSS.

I'm skipping hosting this on AWS for now and opting to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) just for ease of hosting.
